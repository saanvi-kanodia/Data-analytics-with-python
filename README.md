## Introduction
This repository aims to provide practical examples of how various statistical methods are applied in data analytics using Python.

## Statistical Methods

### Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.

- **Mean (Average)**: The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
  ```python
  mean = sum(data) / len(data)
- **Median**: The middle value in a dataset when the values are sorted.
    ```python
  median = np.median(data)
- **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
  ```python
  mode = stats.mode(data)
- **Standard Deviation**: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.
  ```python
  std_dev = np.std(data)
- **Variance**: The average of the squared differences from the mean
  ```python
  variance = np.var(data)
  
### Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics allow us to make inferences about a population based on a sample.

- **Confidence Interval**: A range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter.
  ```python
  confidence_interval = stats.norm.interval(0.95, loc=mean, scale=std_dev)

### Regression Analysis
used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

- **Simple Linear Regression**: A method to predict the dependent variable based on one independent variable.
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X, y)
  y_pred = model.predict(X)

### Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a method for testing a claim or hypothesis about a parameter in a population.

- **t-test**: A statistical test used to compare the means of two groups.
    ```python
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
    
## Python Libraries Used

- numpy: For numerical operations.
- scipy: For scientific computing and statistics.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
